This repository is a temporary module for revel.

The main purpose of the module is to serve static file, without Content-Disposition header. I have tried many ways to do that (Interceptors, Filters, etc) and nothing works without this dramatic module.

We WILL remove this once the bug is fixed. For now, unfortunately, we have to use this.
